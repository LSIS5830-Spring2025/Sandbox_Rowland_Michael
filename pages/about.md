## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata

The template repository features six objects from the First Encounter Assault Recon, or F.E.A.R., franchise. F.E.A.R. is a series of video games created between 2005 and 2011, which has been of interest to me since I played the first of them several years ago. This collection includes text describing the games and .png images displaying their covers. All F.E.A.R. games feature first-person shooter gameplay enhanced with slow-motion mechanics and effects, as well as a quality story about a corporation's desire to create psychically-controlled "super-soldiers" at any cost. Users include anyone who happens to be interested in the franchise and looking for quick information about the individual games.
